# Homebrew formula for Cepheus.
#
# Install:
#   brew tap su1ph3r/cepheus https://github.com/Su1ph3r/Cepheus
#   brew install cepheus
#
# The formula downloads the prebuilt darwin binary attached to the
# GitHub Release rather than the Python sdist + dependency tree — keeps
# `brew install cepheus` fast and avoids dragging in a full Python
# stack just for the CLI.
#
# When bumping the version:
#   1. Update `version` to match pyproject.toml.
#   2. Update `url` paths for both architectures to the new release tag.
#   3. Update `sha256` values from the SHA256SUMS file attached to the
#      release (release.yml computes these automatically).
#   4. Commit alongside the version bump so `brew tap` users see the
#      new version on `brew update`.
#
# Skip steps 2-3 entirely by deleting this file's sha256 lines and
# letting Homebrew prompt for fresh hashes — easier during initial
# development, mandatory for published taps.
